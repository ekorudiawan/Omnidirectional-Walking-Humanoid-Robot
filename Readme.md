# Omnidirectional Walking Pattern Generator for Humanoid Robot
By: Eko Rudiawan 

**Overview**
This is an implementation of omnidirectional walking pattern generator of humanoid robot. The input is step length in x and y direction and step rotation. The output is COM trajectory, left foot and right foot trajectory in 3D space (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw). This is a basic concept how to implement a walk engine on humanoid robot. This code can be expanded with inverse kinematics solver to make a robot walk in desired command.
